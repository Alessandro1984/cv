# Personal cv built with pagedown

This is the repo of my cv. It is developed with the R package *pagedown*. I have consulted the following sources:

- [pagedown: Create Paged HTML Documents for Printing from R Markdown](https://pagedown.rbind.io/)
- [Create Your Resume with Pagedown Package in R](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-your-resume-with-pagedown-package-in-r-123ca6310d52)
- [Nick Strayer's pagedown rendered CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv)

Yes, I know. It's not 100% automated but time is what it is so I had to cut it short ðŸ˜œâ€¼
