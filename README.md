# Personal cv built with pagedown

This is the repo of my cv. It is developed with the R package *pagedown*. I have consulted the following sources:

- [pagedown: Create Paged HTML Documents for Printing from R Markdown](https://pagedown.rbind.io/)
- [Create Your Resume with Pagedown Package in R by Abhinav Malasi](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-your-resume-with-pagedown-package-in-r-123ca6310d52)
- [Nick Strayer's pagedown rendered CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv)
- [Building my resumÃ© in R by Anneke Lincoln Schoeman](https://annekelincoln.com/resume-in-r/)
- Here the the [js function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72167895/pagedown-html-resume-how-to-move-disclaimer-section-within-aside-section-to-th) to push the disclaimer to the bottom of the last page that I have brutally copied and pasted into my code
- If you want to leave the grey aside bar on the first page [here how you do it](https://community.rstudio.com/t/pagedown-html-resume-with-aside-on-first-page-only/46351). Code by wjakethompson and rlesur.

Yes, I know. My resume is not 100% automated but time is a scarce resource so I had to cut it short ðŸ˜œâ€¼
